\section{Introduction}
In this document we will discuss a solution for the concept of the navUP system. Which will allow students to be able to navigate through campus to any lecture hall as fast as possible while taking the least congested route.
\subsection {Purpose}
The sole purpose of this document is to define the requirements of the system as well as the technologies that may ( or may not be used ) to develop this product, as well as different ideas that may be plausible to implement based on difficulty as well as time efficiency. We will try and do an in-depth analysis of the concept of navUP as well as technologies already available for us on campus and technologies we can utilize to implement this product. We will attempt to find the best solution for the product as well as iron out issues that may arise later during the course of the project. 
\subsection {Scope}
Design and implement a mobile application that uses the University of Pretoria's campus wi-fi that will deliver a navigational service to users via their smart devices. The application will be named NavUp. The application should contain all the basic functionalities that are already found in common navigation systems.Other functionality required includes searching, saving and providing directions to a location. A UI(User-Interface) is also required to allow users to interact with the application. It should be usable by different types of users allowing them to enter different kinds of information into the system regarding venues, points of interest, events and activities using multiple types of devices and services. (See References Page)

\subsection{Overview}
An in detail overview will be given within the rest of the sections. Including ideas, technologies, charateristics etc.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{System Environment}
The NavUP system will have 4  basic mediums in which communication will be spread: \\ 1.Students(Users) \\ 2.Mobile Application User Interface( UI)\\ 3.Campus Wi-Fi Hot Spots \\ 4.GPS 
\subsubsection{Users}
The users will connect to the mobile application through the campus wi-fi, every user will be connected to a particular hotspot. Every connection from a user to a hotspot will be tracked in real time and that information will be used accordingly to monitor how many people are in a certain location.
\subsubsection {Mobile Application User Interface(UI)}
Users will use the UI to select where they want to go as well as selecting the shortest route or the fastest route based on hot-spot connections. The mobile application will then use GPS to locate the user and provide an optimal route.
\subsubsection {Campus Wi-Fi Hot Spots}
The mobile application will keep track as to how many people are logged in and then use GPS to determine how many people are in the vicinity of an area which will also be done using the Wi-Fi hotspot using real time tracking. This will enable users to keep track as to how many people are in a certain location and will allow use to avoid highly congested routes. 
\subsubsection{GPS-needs checking-}
GPS will be used to keep track of users through the mobile application. This will allow users to see where they are currently(even when wi-fi is not available) and allow us to determine what will be the best route for the user to their venue. Every user will also be able to see how many people are in a certain location(hotspots) as well as choose the shortest route or fastest route based on the location of the hotspots.

\textbf{Basic Path} & 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Connect to Wi-Fi network
  \item Activate GPS
  \item Open mobile app
  \item Find Location
  \item Confirm Location
  \item Application calculates path to destination
  \item User navigates to destination
  \item When user enters destination building, Bluetooth beacons are used to calculate floor of user well as exact location and floor of destination and calculates path to class

\textbf{Alternative Path} & In\textbf{ step 1}, if the user cannot connect to a Wi-Fi network, GPS must be used to determine location
  \newline In \textbf{step 2}, if satellite is down or GPS cannot obtain location, Wi-Fi triangulation is used to determine user location
 \newline  In \textbf{step 4},if location cannot be determined a message is displayed alerting user that location could not be determined

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
 
\subsubsection{Campus/ Location}
By this we mean all the buldings and venues (lecture halls, labs, sports fields etc..) on campus that has to be incoparated in the system.
\subsubsection{Wifi access points}
As there is over 1000 wi-fi connection points it will play a major role for the application.
\subsubsection{Reliability of NavUP}
As students will use the application find venues, the application has to be reliable in such a way students reach to their desired destination.
\subsubsection{Performance of NavUP}
Performance will come into play with the wifi signal strengh in and out the buildings and crowd sourcing which shows the congestion on the routes you taking.
\subsubsection{Usability of NavUP}
Interfaces needs to be designed for different levels of user. The application should be usable for different types of users that will be using the system.
\subsubsection{Maintainance}
Access will be provided to the network team and the development team for the maintainace of the application.
\subsubsection{Data Integrity of the NavUP}
Data of provided by the application should be correct as there will be a lot of push notification of activities and gamification (reward systems)
